# MEMU - Memotech EMUlator

The [Memotech MTX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memotech_MTX) series of computers were superior
8-bit computers of the 1980s. Although initially supplied with a ROM BASIC later addons included
disk drives of various formats, which could be accessed from extensions to the ROM BASIC or the
system could boot CP/M 2.2.

The definitive source of information about Memotech computers is
[Dave Stevenson's site](http://primrosebank.net/computers/mtx/mtx512.htm).

MEMU is a full featured emulator of the MTX systems originally written by
Andy Key. Andy's version of MEMU is available for Microsoft Windows or Linux from
[here](http://www.nyangau.org/memu/memu.htm).

This repository was originally just a port of MEMU to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico. Work is in
progress to re-integrate versions for other platforms. It currently includes versions for:

* Raspberry Pi Pico: A cut-down version due to Pico capacity limits.
* Linux X-Window: Displays in multiple windows.
* Linux Framebuffer: No GUI required. One display at a time, full-screen.
* Microsoft Windows: Does not have DART or Network emulation.

This version of the code is very much a work in progress as new ports are merged. There are
probably bugs, and there is certainly diagnostic code.

For build and usage information, see the [documentation](docs/index.html).
